            Content Management System
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 text-justify">
            As part of the Software Engineering 2 course, I led the development
            of a modular and efficient Content Management System (CMS). This
            project enhanced my skills in team management, allowing me to
            coordinate efforts among team members effectively. I also mastered
            modular structuring, ensuring the system's components were scalable
            and maintainable, and focused on task distribution to streamline
            development and meet deadlines efficiently. The CMS provided
            practical experience in balancing technical implementation with
            collaborative teamwork.
